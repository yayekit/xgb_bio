## Supervised Learning Example

File: `supervised_learning_example.py`

This script demonstrates a basic supervised learning task using a Decision Tree Classifier.

### Features:
- Adds synthetic data for a binary classification problem
- Splits data into training and testing sets
- Trains a Decision Tree Classifier
- Makes predictions on the test set
- Calculates and prints the accuracy of the model

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

### Usage:
```
python supervised_learning_example.py
```

## Unsupervised Learning Example

File: `unsupervised_learning_example.py`

This script showcases an unsupervised learning task using K-means clustering.

### Features:
- Generates synthetic 2D data
- Applies K-means clustering to group the data into 3 clusters
- Visualizes the clustered data and centroids using matplotlib

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

### Usage:
```
python unsupervised_learning_example.py
```
